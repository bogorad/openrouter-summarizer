## ‚ú® What's New Since Version 2.0

*   Centralized all prompt strings in `constants.js` for easier management and modification.
*   Allowing for incorrect output of LLAMA4-scout model.
*   Fixed obsessive tranlation to English bug.
*   The initial summary prompt now instructs the LLM to determine the language of the input text and summarize in that language, rather than explicitly requesting a specific language. (v3.0.7)

## üöÄ Features

*   **Summarize Anything:** `ALT+hover` to highlight, then `ALT+Click` any element on a web page to select and summarize it.
*   **Interactive Chat:** Engage in follow-up conversations with the LLM based on the summarized content or the original HTML snippet.
*   **Rich Formatting:**
*   **Flexible Model Selection:** Choose from a default list or add/edit any OpenRouter-compatible model ID in the Options. Your selection syncs across sessions. Supports `:nitro`, `:floor` and `:auto`.
*   **Configurable Languages for Chat Flags:** Manage a list of preferred languages in the Options. Corresponding flag icons will appear on the chat popup. Clicking a flag initiates a request to translate the last message.
*   **Languages can now be reordered** by dragging them in the Options list.
*   **Customizable Prompt:** Modify the core formatting instructions sent to the LLM via the Advanced Options section.
*   **Configurable Summary:** Choose the approximate number of summary points (3-8) for the initial summary prompt.
*   **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Use `Ctrl+Enter` / `Cmd+Enter` to send messages in the chat window.
*   **Instant Results:** Summaries appear in a clean popup; chat happens in a dedicated tab.
*   **Secure & Private:** Your API key and options are stored locally in your browser storage. Chat context is stored temporarily in session storage. Nothing is sent anywhere except OpenRouter.ai when you request a summary or chat response.
*   **Debug-Friendly:** Enable debug mode in Options for detailed console logging. The API key is filtered from the debug console messages.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1.  **Install & Setup:**
    *   Install the extension.
    *   The Options page opens on first install. Enter your [OpenRouter.ai API Key](https://openrouter.ai/keys).
    *   Review default models/languages/settings. **Save Options**.
2.  **Select Content:**
    *   On any webpage, hold <kbd>ALT</kbd> + Hover to preview highlightable elements (blue dashed outline).
    *   <kbd>ALT</kbd>+Click an element to select it (red solid outline). A floating icon (üí°) appears.
3.  **Summarize:**
    *   Click the floating icon (üí°), *or* right-click and choose "Send to LLM", *or* click the extension toolbar icon.
    *   The extension sends the element's HTML and your configured prompt (requesting a JSON array of HTML strings) to the selected OpenRouter model. The prompt now instructs the LLM to determine the language of the input text and summarize in that language.
4.  **Review Summary:**
    *   The summary (received as a JSON array of strings) is parsed and appears in the popup, rendered as a clean HTML list (`<ul><li>...</ul>`). Potential code fences (``````json ... ``````) around the JSON are automatically stripped. LLM responses containing multiple JSON arrays or trailing text are handled more robustly.
    *   **Click the "Chat" button to open the chat tab.**
    *   Use **Copy** or **Close**.
5.  **Chat (Optional):**
    *   Click **Chat** on the summary popup to chat about the summary.
    *   A new browser tab opens. An info banner confirms context is available.
    *   The original HTML snippet and the raw/processed JSON string are stored. For *every* message you send, the original HTML snippet is automatically prepended to the recent chat history before sending to the LLM for context.
    *   **Language flags are now available in the chat interface.** Click a flag to request a translation of the *last assistant message* into that language. **While the LLM is processing a request, these flags will be visually dimmed and show a "busy" tooltip.**
    *   Type follow-up questions. Use `Ctrl+Enter` / `Cmd+Enter` to send.
    *   LLM responses are rendered with via basic HTML (`<b>`/`<i>`) but full markdown is recognized via the `marked` library.
    *   Use **Copy MD**, **Download MD**, or **Download JSON** to save the chat.

## üîí Privacy & Permissions

*   **Permissions Used:**
    *   `activeTab`, `scripting`: To interact with the page for selection and UI.
    *   `contextMenus`: For the right-click menu option.
    *   `storage`: To save API key/preferences (`sync`) and temporary chat context (`session`).
    *   `<all_urls>`: To allow selection on any website.
    *   **`web_accessible_resources`**: Used for accessing static assets (icons, flags, JS libraries like `marked.min.js`) and dynamically imported content script modules (`highlighter.js`, `floatingIcon.js`, `summaryPopup.js`, `constants.js`) from content scripts/pages.
*   **Your Data:**
    *   **API Key & Settings:** Stored locally in `chrome.storage.sync`. Only sent to OpenRouter.ai upon request. Prompt templates and your configured language list are also stored here.
    *   **Selected HTML & Summary:** Sent to OpenRouter.ai for summary/chat requests.
    *   **Chat Context:** Original HTML snippet and raw/processed JSON string stored temporarily in `chrome.storage.session` for the chat tab. Cleared when the browser session ends. The HTML snippet is re-sent with subsequent chat messages for context.
    *   **No Analytics:** No tracking or ads.
*   **Security:**
    *   Renders HTML list/Markdown. Does **not** execute scripts or load external resources from LLM responses. Relies on `marked` for chat rendering. Static assets like SVGs and dynamically imported JS modules are loaded securely from within the extension bundle via `chrome.runtime.getURL`.

**Q: Why aren't all my configured flags showing in the popup?**
A: The flags have been moved to the chat interface for better organization and to avoid cluttering the summary popup.

**Q: How are flags chosen for languages?**
A: The extension attempts to use an SVG flag file (`[language_code].svg`) from the `country-flags/svg/` directory based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1" target="_blank">ISO 639-1</a> code associated with that language in the `languages.json` file. If a flag file for a specific language code is not available in the extension bundle, a generic placeholder flag will be displayed.

## Technical updates

*   **Fixed Chat Context Error:** Stored the selected element's HTML snippet in a global variable (`lastSelectedDomSnippet`) in `pageInteraction.js` when the floating icon is clicked, and used this stored snippet when opening the chat tab. This resolves the "no element selected" error when clicking the chat button after the summary appears. (v3.0.18)
*   **Fixed Popup Callback Requirement:** Changed the `onCopy` callback passed to `SummaryPopup.showPopup` in `pageInteraction.js` from `null` to a no-op function (`() => {}`) to satisfy the function type requirement in `summaryPopup.js`. (v3.0.13)
*   **Fixed Popup Update Timing:** Modified `summaryPopup.js` to return a Promise from `showPopup` that resolves when the popup is visible and ready, and updated `pageInteraction.js` to `await` this Promise before calling `updatePopupContent`. This resolves the "updatePopupContent called but popup doesn't exist" error. (v3.0.12)
*   **Centralized Translation Prompt:** Moved the user message template used for translation requests (triggered by clicking a language flag in the chat) to `constants.js` as `CHAT_TRANSLATION_REQUEST_TEMPLATE`. (v3.0.9)
*   **Removed No-Op Function:** Removed the `updatePopupFlags` function from `summaryPopup.js` as it was explicitly a no-op and flags are now handled in the chat interface. (v3.0.14)
*   **Exported Default Constants:** Exported `DEFAULT_FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS` and `DEFAULT_POSTAMBLE_TEXT` from `constants.js` to resolve import errors in `background.js` and `options.js`. (v3.0.8)
*   **Prompt Language Determination:** The initial summary prompt now instructs the LLM to determine the language of the input text and summarize in that language. The extension no longer explicitly requests the summary in the first configured language. (v3.0.7)
*   **Fixed Syntax Error:** Corrected a missing closing curly brace in the `openChatWithContext` function in `pageInteraction.js`.
*   **Centralized Prompt Strings:** All prompt templates and fixed prompt parts have been moved to `constants.js` for better organization and maintainability.
*   **Options Page Reload:** The options page now reloads automatically after saving settings to ensure all changes are fully applied and the UI is consistent.
*   **Flags Moved to Chat:** Language flags are now displayed in the chat interface instead of the summary popup footer.
*   **Simplified Summary Popup:** The summary popup footer now contains only "Copy", "Chat", and "Close" buttons. The "Chat" button initiates the chat tab with the summary context.
*   **Chat Translation Feature:** Added functionality to translate the last assistant message in the chat by clicking a language flag button.
*   **Improved Summary Popup UI:**
    *   Redesigned the footer with language flags as buttons and a central "CHAT" button.
    *   Enhanced flag visibility with a light gray background.
    *   Fixed flag positioning.
*   **Smarter Summaries:**
    *   Initial summaries are now requested in the original text's language.
    *   Fixed a bug preventing the correct summary model from being passed to and shown in the chat context.
*   **Robust Summary/Chat Parsing:**
    *   Improved logic to reliably parse LLM responses, correctly handling summaries or chat messages containing multiple or embedded JSON arrays, even without code fences.
    *   Structured JSON array output (5 items) is now requested from the LLM.
*   **Enhanced Chat Functionality:**
    *   Implemented a "Stop" button to cancel ongoing chat requests.
    *   Fixed issues with the Stop button remaining visible or error messages persisting incorrectly.
    *   Resolved bugs related to chat submission (Send button and Ctrl+Enter).
    *   Fixed `TypeError` related to language selection (`chatTargetLanguage`).
    *   Ensured clicking language flags correctly initiates translation requests in the chat.
    *   Improved chat UI rendering for better message display and consistency.
    *   Assistant responses containing JSON arrays are now rendered as structured HTML lists.
    *   Fixed parsing of the initial summary context when opening the chat.
*   **Removed Health Check:** The explicit health check message from the content script has been removed. Configuration validation is now handled directly within the summary request processing in the background script.
*   **Flag Busy State:** Language flags in the chat interface are now visually dimmed and show a "busy" tooltip while the LLM is processing a request. (v3.0.15)
*   **Temporary Error Messages:** Temporary error messages (like "Chat is busy") now automatically disappear after a short duration. (v3.0.16)

## Core Improvements & Fixes

*   **Refactored Codebase:**
    *   Major refactoring of the content script (`pageInteraction.js`) into distinct modules (`highlighter.js`, `floatingIcon.js`, `summaryPopup.js`) for better organization.
    *   Standardized version/update headers added to JS files.
*   **Centralized Settings:**
    *   Settings management is now handled centrally by `background.js`, improving consistency and simplifying access for other components.
*   **Improved Error Handling:**
    *   Better handling and logging for errors when communicating with closed tabs or channels (e.g., "message channel closed", "Receiving end does not exist").
    *   Fixed issues where immediate validation errors (like missing API key) weren't shown correctly in the summary popup.
    *   Enhanced validation for API keys, models, and language lists in `background.js`.
*   **Enhanced Debugging:**
    *   Added more detailed debug logging (e.g., for API key retrieval, full LLM responses, health checks) while removing debug info from the user-facing popup UI.
    *   Improved log consistency and API key sanitization.
*   **Options Page Improvements:**
    *   Fixed saving/loading of custom model lists (including labels).
    *   Ensured the UI updates correctly after resetting options to default.
    *   Added post-save verification to check data integrity.
    *   Prevented settings from being saved prematurely during language selection.
    *   Fixed issues related to language data loading.
*   **Language Handling:**
    *   Standardized internal property naming (`language_info`), simplified language data structures, and fixed issues with language data availability during initialization.
*   **Version Consistency:**
    *   Updated version numbers across all relevant files (targeting v2.30, v2.31, and later up to ~v2.50.13 implicitly).
