## ‚ú® HTML-Formatted Summaries

Summaries now **display with all HTML formatting as returned by your LLM prompts**, so you‚Äôll see bold, italics, and lists for maximum clarity.  
For instance, if the LLM replies:

```json
[
  "<b>Main finding</b>: The science is clear.",
  "<b>Impacts</b>: People everywhere benefit."
]
```

‚Ä¶you will see in the popup:

- **Main finding**: The science is clear.
- **Impacts**: People everywhere benefit.

This makes summaries clearer and visually structured.
