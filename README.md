## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Why do I need an API key?**  
A: The extension uses OpenRouter.ai's API to generate summaries and chat responses. You need your own key (free tiers often available).

**Q: Why OpenRouter?**  
A: It provides access to a wide variety of LLMs through a single API, often with competitive pricing and good performance.

**Q: Is my data safe?**  
A: Yes. Your API key and settings stay in your browser storage. Selected text/HTML is sent to OpenRouter only upon your request. Chat context uses temporary session storage. See the Privacy section for details.

**Q: How does the Chat feature work?**  
A: When you click "Chat" on a summary, the original HTML you selected and the summary text are passed to the chat tab. This context is included with your *first* chat message to the LLM, allowing you to ask relevant follow-up questions.

**Q: Can I customize the models and languages in the Options?**  
A: Yes! Version 2.0 introduces editable lists for both models and translation languages. Add any valid OpenRouter model ID or any target language name.

**Q: Is rendering Markdown from the LLM safe?**  
A: We use the `marked` library to convert Markdown to HTML. While generally safe for standard Markdown, it's always wise to be cautious about unexpected or complex outputs from LLMs. The library is configured for standard GFM and breaks, and does not execute embedded scripts by default.
