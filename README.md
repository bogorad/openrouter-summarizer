---

## üöÄ Features

- **Summarize Anything:** `ALT+hover` to highlight, then `ALT+Click` any element on a web page to select and summarize it.
- **Native HTML Summaries:** LLM returns properly formatted HTML bullet lists with preserved formatting (bold text, etc.).
- **Copy HTML:** Use the new Copy HTML icon (üìÑ) in the floating menu to copy complete element HTML to clipboard.
- **Enhanced Copy Function:** Copy button preserves bold formatting in both rich text (HTML) and plain text (markdown) formats.
- **Interactive Chat:** Engage in follow-up conversations with the LLM based on the summarized content or the original HTML snippet.
- **Flexible Model Selection:** Choose from a default list or add/edit any OpenRouter-compatible model ID in the Options. Your selection syncs across sessions. Supports `:nitro`, `:floor` and `:auto`.
- **Configurable Languages for Chat Flags:** Manage a list of preferred languages in the Options. Corresponding flag icons will appear on the chat popup. Clicking a flag initiates a request to translate the last message.
- **Languages can now be reordered** by dragging them in the Options list.
- **Customizable Prompt:** Modify the core formatting instructions sent to the LLM via the Advanced Options section. Supports `$$$language$$$` and `$$$bulletCount$$$` placeholders.
- **Fully Functional Summary Configuration:** Choose the number of summary points (3-8) - this setting now actually works and dynamically updates the prompt.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:**
  - **Summary popup:** `Y` to copy, `C` to chat, `N` for NewsBlur, `Escape` to close
  - **Joplin dialog:** `Enter` to save, `Escape` to close
  - **Chat window:** `Ctrl/Cmd+Enter` to send messages
- **Instant Results:** Summaries appear in a clean popup; chat happens in a dedicated tab.
- **Secure & Private:** Your API key and options are stored locally in your browser storage. Chat context is stored temporarily in session storage. Nothing is sent anywhere except OpenRouter.ai when you request a summary or chat response.
- **Smart Content Cleanup:** Automatically removes unwanted elements like ads, tracking scripts, navigation menus, social media widgets, and promotional content before processing, ensuring cleaner summaries and better LLM performance.
- **Comprehensive Debug Logging:** Enable debug mode in `Options` for detailed console logging throughout all processes including language detection, summary processing, and API calls. The API key is filtered from debug messages.
- **Joplin support:** Save to Joplin instead of summarizing.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1.  **Install & Setup:**
    - Install the extension.
    - The Options page opens on first install. Enter your [OpenRouter.ai API Key](https://openrouter.ai/keys).
    - Review default models/languages/settings. **Save Options**.
2.  **Select Content:**
    - On any webpage, hold <kbd>ALT</kbd> + Hover to preview highlightable elements (blue dashed outline).
    - <kbd>ALT</kbd>+Click an element to select it (red solid outline). A floating menu appears with up to 3 icons:
      - **üí° Summarize:** Main summarization icon
      - **‚úÇÔ∏è Joplin:** Save to Joplin (if token configured)
      - **üìÑ Copy HTML:** Copy element's complete HTML to clipboard
3.  **Choose Action:**
    - **Summarize:** Click the main icon (üí°), _or_ right-click and choose "Send to LLM".
    - **Copy HTML:** Click the Copy HTML icon (üìÑ) to copy sanitized element HTML to clipboard.
    - **Save to Joplin:** Click the Joplin icon (‚úÇÔ∏è) to save content to a Joplin notebook.
    - The extension extracts the selected element's HTML, applies comprehensive sanitization to remove unwanted content (ads, tracking, navigation elements), converts it to Markdown to save money and improve LLM's job, then sends it and your configured prompt (requesting a JSON array of HTML strings) to the selected OpenRouter model for summarization.
4.  **Review Summary:**
    - The summary (received as a JSON array of strings) is parsed and appears in the popup, rendered as a clean HTML list (`<ul><li>...</ul>`). Potential code fences (`json ... `) around the JSON are automatically stripped. LLM responses containing multiple JSON arrays or trailing text are handled more robustly.
    - **Use keyboard shortcuts for quick actions:**
      - **Y** - Copy summary to clipboard
      - **C** - Open chat interface (if enabled)
      - **N** - Share to NewsBlur (if token configured)
      - **Escape** - Close the popup
    - **Or use buttons:** **Copy**, **Chat**, **NewsBlur**, or **Close**.
    - Use **[NewsBlur](https://www.newsblur.com/)** to share the summary and the selected HTML snippet.
5.  **Chat (Optional):**
    - Click **Chat** on the summary popup to chat about the summary.
    - A new browser tab opens. An info banner confirms context is available.
    - The original HTML snippet and the raw/processed JSON string are stored. For _every_ message you send, the original HTML snippet is automatically prepended to the recent chat history before sending to the LLM for context.
    - **Language flags are now available in the chat interface.** Click a flag to request a translation of the _last assistant message_ into that language. **While the LLM is processing a request, these flags will be visually dimmed and show a "busy" tooltip.**
    - Type follow-up questions. Use `Ctrl+Enter` / `Cmd+Enter` to send using any of the configured models.
    - LLM responses are rendered with via basic HTML (`<b>`/`<i>`) but full markdown is recognized via the `marked` library.
    - Use **Copy MD**, **Download MD**, or **Download JSON** to save the chat.

## üîí Privacy & Permissions

- **Permissions Used:**
  - `activeTab`, `scripting`: To interact with the page for selection and UI.
  - `contextMenus`: For the right-click menu option.
  - `storage`: To save API key/preferences (`sync`) and temporary chat context (`session`).
  - `<all_urls>`: To allow selection on any website.
  - **`web_accessible_resources`**: Used for accessing static assets (icons, flags, JS libraries like `marked.min.js`) and dynamically imported content script modules (`highlighter.js`, `floatingIcon.js`, `summaryPopup.js`, `constants.js`) from content scripts/pages.
- **Your Data:**
  - **API Key & Settings:** Stored locally in `chrome.storage.sync`. Only sent to OpenRouter.ai upon request. Prompt templates and your configured language list are also stored here.
  - **Selected HTML & Summary:** Sent to OpenRouter.ai for summary/chat requests.
  - **Chat Context:** Original HTML snippet and raw/processed JSON string stored temporarily in `chrome.storage.session` for the chat tab. Cleared when the browser session ends. The HTML snippet is re-sent with subsequent chat messages for context.
  - **No Analytics:** No tracking or ads.
- **Security:**
  - Renders HTML list/Markdown. Does **not** execute scripts or load external resources from LLM responses. Relies on `marked` for chat rendering. Static assets like SVGs and dynamically imported JS modules are loaded securely from within the extension bundle via `chrome.runtime.getURL`.

**Q: Why aren't all my configured flags showing in the popup?**
A: The flags have been moved to the chat interface for better organization and to avoid cluttering the summary popup.

**Q: How are flags chosen for languages?**
A: The extension attempts to use an SVG flag file (`[language_code].svg`) from the `country-flags/svg/` directory based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1" target="_blank">ISO 639-1</a> code associated with that language in the `languages.json` file. If a flag file for a specific language code is not available in the extension bundle, a generic placeholder flag will be displayed.
